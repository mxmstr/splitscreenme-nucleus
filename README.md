Nucleus Co-op is a free and open source tool for Windows that allows split-screen play on many games that do not initially support it.

- Huge increase to the amount of compatible games
- Much more customization (via game scripts)
- Support for any number of players
- Quality of life improvements
- Bug fixes
- Multi Keyboard and Mice support
- And so much more!

# How does Nucleus Co-op work?
Nucleus Co-op opens multiple instances of the same game (only 1 copy of the game is required in majority of cases) and connects those instances via LAN or steamworks online multiplayer emulation, but on the same PC. All while making sure all the windows have focus so they can be playable with gamepads or that the instances are playable even in the background. Nucleus then resizes, removes borders and repositions the games windows so you can have synthetic splitscreen to play locally with your friends.

# Installation:
1. Download the latest release. 
2. Extract .zip archive to a non-restrictive folder, that all users have access to (i.e. do NOT extract to Program Files, Desktop, or your Documents folder, to name a few). The root folder that contains majority of your games is a good choice (e.g. C:\).

# Prerequisites:
- .NET Framework 4.7.2 or higher  
- Microsoft Visual C++ 2015-2019 Redistributable (both x86 and x64)

# How can you contribute?
Please report any bugs you may find and provide any feedback you have regarding the mod. I am always open to suggestions and I want to make split-screen available for every game, for everyone! Don't forget to create game scripts and share!

You can find me on the Nucleus subreddit/discord as well as the Splitscreen Dreams discord, a special community created specifically for making games non-split-screen games split-screen. Message me on discord, ZeroFox#5866, or Talos91#8419 if you're interested in contributing.

In addition, I accept donations should you wish to support my endevor. It is greatly appreciated but completely voluntary, I will continue my best to help the community and enhance this project.

Thank you ^_^
