# Nucleus Co-Op & Unofficial Mod
Nucleus Co-Op is a free and open source tool for Windows that allows split-screen play on many games that do not initially support it.

- Huge increase to the amount of compabitle games
- Much more customization (via game scripts)
- Support for any number of players
- Quality of life improvements
- Bug fixes

# How does Nucleus Co-Op work?
Nucleus Co-Op opens multiple instances of the same game (only 1 copy of the game is required in majority of cases) and connects those instances via LAN or steamworks online multiplayer emulation, but on the same PC. All while making sure all the windows have focus so they can be playable with gamepads or that the instances are playable even in the background. Nucleus then resizes, removes borders and repositions the games windows so you can have synthetic splitscreen to play locally with your friends.

# Installation:
Download the latest release. Extract .rar archive to a non-restrictive folder, that all users have access to (i.e. do NOT extract to Program Files, Desktop, or your Documents folder, to name a few). The root folder that contains majority of your games is a good choice (e.g. C:\).

# Prerequisites:
.NET Framework 4.7.2 or higher  
Microsoft Visual C++ 2015-2019 Redistributable (both x86 and x64)

# How can you contribute?
Please report any bugs you may find and provide any feedback you have regarding the mod. I am always open to suggestions and I want to make split-screen available for every game, for everyone! Don't forget to create game scripts and share!
