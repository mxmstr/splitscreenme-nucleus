Nucleus Co-op - version 2.2.2

Nucleus Co-op is a free and open source tool for Windows that allows split-screen play on many games that do not initially support it, the app purpose is to make it as easy as possible for the average user to play games locally using only one PC and one game copy.

https://github.com/SplitScreen-Me/splitscreenme-nucleus

This is a new and improved official version of the Nucleus Co-op application and is part of the SplitScreen.Me github organization, it includes the following:

1. New and improved options in game handlers:

Note: If you want to create your own handler also read the MasterHandler.js in Nucleus Co-op handlers folder alongside this info.

#################### Game Info ####################

Game.ExecutableName = "Game.exe";                       //The name of the game executable with the extension. This will be used by Nucleus to add games, to run the game and as process to follow for positioning and resizing. 
Game.ExecutableToLaunch = "Game.exe";		        //If the game is to launch a different executable, other than what Game.ExecutableName is.
Game.LauncherExe = "Launcher.exe";                      //If the game needs to go through a launcher before opening Nucleus will use this exe to start the game and it will still use the Game.ExecutableName process for positioning and resizing. 
Game.GUID = "Game Name";                                //The name of the folder that will be created inside the Nucleus content folder (just use letters not symbols). In this folder Nucleus will store the symlinked or copied game files for each instance of the game.

Game.MaxPlayers = 16;                                   //This is just the max players info that shows under the handler name in Nucleus UI. Usually we write the max number of players the game supports. (PC, should support 16 max connected input devices).

Known Issues: --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Force feedback does not work with Nucleus custom dlls.
- PreventWindowDeactivation will prevent mouse and keyboard input on instances using this hook (and may have other adverse effects).
- Status Window may cause Nucleus to crash every now and then.

Changelog: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v2.2.2 - January xx, 2024

 -Fixed an issue with the unsecured path check preventing handler startup if a game is installed in the default Steam installation path: Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\.
 -Disabled using xinput indexes by default for gamepad auto assignment (broke controller support in some handlers that rely on device id). Now the user will have to press a button on each gamepad for the controller icons to show in every handler, same as the multiple keyboards/mice icons work.
 -Improved Context.StartProcess().
 -Fixed automatic Steam language detection (deprecated code). Added Latam language option in Nucleus settings too.
 -Added the updated macstyle theme by V.
 -Fixed gamepad ui navigation virtual mouse appearing onto the setup screen.                           
 -Fixed Nucleus window location beeing restored on non available screen area(disconnected screen).
 -Fixed more typos.

v2.2.1 - January 06, 2024

 -Fixed a bug affecting handlers using Devreorder (e.g. Star Wars: Battlefront II Classic).
 -Fixed a bug deleting a player if his attached controller has been unplugged. Fixes Nucleus Co-op crashing when disconnecting a controller during a handler launch.
 -Fixed typos.
 -Fixed the updater. 

v2.2.0 - January 01, 2024

 - Added basic gamepad UI navigation, can be enabled/disabled in settings. 
 - Added gamepad support to all Nucleus shortcuts.
 - Fixed UI highlighting the wrong controller in the UI when polling and controller sometimes being wrongly assigned in-game.
 - Instances launch order changed from left to right/top to bottom to the order that input devices icons are dropped on each screen (same for single monitor). P1,P2,P3 etc. on the setup screen represent the launch order now.
 - Removed the splashscreen.
 - Better sorting of the game list.
 - Better userprofile.json indentation.
 - Added Goldberg emulator updater.
 - Now Nucleus will try to unlock all the original game files (read only files) before symlinking, hard copying etc.

 - Fixed an issue with Steamless not applying when the game executable is inside a bin folder.
 - Nucleus Co-op will not get stuck if the hub is down now (will still take ~ 4 seconds waiting for hub response).
 - Added placeholder text for Game.Options:  Game.AddOption("Title", "Description", "Option Name" , [leave empty]); // var option = Context.Options["Option Name"];  to retrieve the typed text. It works like the regular one but with an empty string array.
 - Added Context.StartProcess(Context.GetFolder(Nucleus.Folder.InstancedGameFolder) + "\\an-executable.exe");
 - Added per-game KeepSymlink option in game menu.
 - Added Context.EditTextFile(string filePath, string[] refLines, string[] newLines, string encoder); //refLines are partial or full strings to look for. newLines are new strings (full strings) that will replace refLines. Adding "Delete" as newLine will delete the corresponding reflLine from the file. Should work with any type of text files (xml, ini, txt). 
 - Added Game.GoldbergNoWarning = true; so Nucleus will not prompt if the Goldberg dlls are missing if the handler supports different platforms.
 - Added Context.PlayerSteamID so we can get players steam ids from Game.Play.
 - Added Context.FindFilePartialName (string sourceFolder, string[] partialNames); 
 - Added Context.GetFileName(string fullFilePath); //get the name of a file from its full path;
 - Added hide taskbar parameter to Context.HideDesktop(); function, Context.HideDesktop(bool hideTaskbar) so no need to add the hide taskbar line.

 - Added debug log button when enabled in settings (opens debug-log.txt and a Nucleus install folder explorer window).
 - Added Context.CopyFolder(string sourcePath,string destinationPath) example => Context.CopyFolder(Context.GetFolder(Nucleus.Folder.InstancedGameFolder) +"\\Engine", Context.GetFolder(Nucleus.Folder.InstancedGameFolder) + "\\Citadel\\Engine");
 - Added Context.DeleteRegKeyValues(string baseKey, string sKey, string[] values); //where values is a string array of the value(s) you want to delete;
 - Added Context.ExtractZip(string sourceZip, string contentDestination,string password);
 - Added Context.EditZipFile(string sourceZip, string password, string savePath, string[] itemsToAdd, string[] entriesToRemove); //itemsToAdd => ["path where to copy in the zip|path of file/folder to add"]; Always add "\\" at the end off the path if the content to remove is a folder;
