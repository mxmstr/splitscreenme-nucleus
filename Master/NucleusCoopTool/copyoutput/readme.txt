Game.WriteToProcessMemory 				//(undocumented)
Game.FlawlessWidescreenPluginPath 			//(undocumented)


~ Custom prompts - Prompt user for input, which can be then used in the handler logic

Game.CustomUserGeneralPrompts = ["Enter ROM name", "Enter filename"];	//This prompts user one time and applies to ALL players, unless a value text file already exists and saving is on
Game.SaveCustomUserGeneralValues = false;
Game.SaveAndEditCustomUserGeneralValues = false;

Game.CustomUserPlayerPrompts = ["Enter network Adapter name", "Enter character name"];	//This will prompt each player, unless a value text file already exists for that player and saving for players is on
Game.SaveCustomUserPlayerValues = false;
Game.SaveAndEditCustomUserPlayerValues = false;

Game.CustomUserInstancePrompts = ["Enter network Adapter name"];	//This will prompt each instance, unless a value text file already exists for that instance and save is on. In case it is not player specific but different values are needed for instances
Game.SaveCustomUserInstanceValues = false;
Game.SaveAndEditCustomUserInstanceValues = false;
Access the user input values via Context.CustomUser(General/Player/Instance)Values[index]


2. Support for multiple mice and keyboards (These options are deprecated, see the new Proto Input guide: https://nucleus-coop.github.io/docs/protoinput/)

3. New methods to be used in game handlers -

Context.ChangeXmlNodeInnerTextValue(string path, string nodeName, string newValue)		//Edit an XML element (previously only nodes and attributes)
Context.ReplaceLinesInTextFile(string path, string[] lineNumAndnewValues)			//Replace an entire line; for string array use the format: "lineNum|newValue", the | is required
Context.ReplacePartialLinesInTextFile(string path, string[] lineNumRegPtrnAndNewValues)		//Partially replace a line; for string array use the format: "lineNum|Regex pattern|newValue", the | is required
Context.RemoveLineInTextFile(string path, int lineNum)						//Removes a given line number completely
Context.RemoveLineInTextFile(string path, string txtInLine, SearchType type)			//Removes a given line number completely
Context.FindLineNumberInTextFile(string path, string searchValue, SearchType type)		//Returns a line number (int), utilizes a newly created enum SearchType
	Each of the above methods, also have an overload method so you can specify a kind of encoding to use (enter string of encoding as last parameter, e.g. "utf-8", "utf-16", "us-ascii")
	- SearchTypes include: "Contains", "Full" and "StartsWith", use like so: Nucleus.SearchType.StartsWith
Context.CreateRegKey(string baseKey, string sKey, string subKey)				//Create a registry key for current user, baseKey can either be "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE" or "HKEY_CURRENT_USER"
Context.DeleteRegKey(string baseKey, string sKey, string subKey)				//Delete a registry key for current user, baseKey can either be "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE" or "HKEY_CURRENT_USER"
Context.EditRegKey(string baseKey, string sKey, string name, object data, RegType type)	//Edit a registry key for current user, baseKey can either be "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE" or "HKEY_CURRENT_USER"
	EditRegKey uses a custom registry data type to use, by using Nucleus.RegType.DWord for example. The last word can be of the same name of RegistryValueKind enum.

Context.KillProcessesMatchingWindowName(string name)						//Kill processes matching a given window name during preperation
Context.IsKeyboardPlayer									//True if current player is using keyboard, useful for logic that is needed for keyboard only player
Context.OrigHeight										//Player monitor's height

Context.FindFiles(string rootFolder, string fileName)						//Return a string array of filenames (and their paths) found that match a pattern you specify
Context.CreatedDate(string file, int year, int month, int day)					//Change the creation date of a file
Context.ModifiedDate(string file, int year, int month, int day)					//Change the last modified date of a file
Context.RunAdditionalFiles(string[] filePaths, bool changeWorkingDir, int secondsToPause)	//Specify additional files to run before launching game. By default will run each additional file once but can specify to run during specific player's instances by prefixing the filepath with #|. Replace # with player number. Can also specify to run files for each player by prefixing filepath with "all|". Optional two extra params, bool run as admin and bool prompt between

- Fixed large files sometimes breaking the symlink process
- Fixed files not being symlinked with different amount of players under the new rule: files will only be copied or symlinked once, if needed
- Fixed Nicknames not always being updated if changed
- Fixed the black window from Hide Desktop not closing when stopping a game session (must press stop or stop session hotkey)
- Added an option in game scripts to set processor affinity per instance

v0.9.8.1 - November 4, 2019
- Reverted folder and file exclusion logic to the way it was done pre-0.9.8 (but still kept improvements made to them)
	- DirSymlinkExclusion will force hardcopy of the folder (if it is to be symlinked), FileSymlinkExclusion will completely ignore the file (no link/copy), FileSymlinkCopyInstead will continue to just create hardcopy of file instead of symlinking it
- Fixed xinput plus controller mappings when keyboard player was any player except last

- Files that get added to the instance folders (goldberg, xinput plus, etc) will no longer be copied over to the original game path and files (as long as SymlinkFolders is false)
	- If SymlinkFolders is true, files WILL be copied over to the original file path
- Files will only be copied or symlinked once, if needed; i.e. if Instance0 path exists with at least one file & KeepSymLinkOnExit is true, Nucleus will skip copying/linking

- Fixed Script Author notes in UI so that long notes will not overlap when placing controllers
- Fixed NeedsSteamEmulation option and added SSE support for x64 games
- Fixed IdInWindowTitle and ForceWindowTitle bug that would prevent them from working

- If a game script has an issue and game doesn't appear, when you fix the issue and launch Nucleus again, you no longer need to re-add the game (game will simply reappear)
- If a file is unable to be deleted after 10 tries during clean-up, do not throw an exception, just carry-on (details are logged)
- PromptBetweenInstances will now show the last prompt (to install hooks) if there are hooks to install OR if FakeFocus is set to true
